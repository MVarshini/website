      <description>Failures in production are costly. To help mitigate risk to service health, consider the following strategies and approaches to service testing:&#xA;Be proactive vs reactive. We have different types of test suites in place - unit, integration and end-to-end - that help expose bugs in code in a controlled environment. Through implementation of a chaos engineering strategy, we can discover potential causes of service degradation. We need to understand the systemsâ€™ behavior under unpredictable conditions in order to find the areas to harden, and use performance data points to size the clusters to handle failures in order to keep downtime to a minimum.</description>

      <description>Hosts container images and wrapper for running scenarios supported by Krkn, a chaos testing tool for Kubernetes clusters to ensure it is resilient to failures. All we need to do is run the containers with the respective environment variables defined as supported by the scenarios without having to maintain and tweak files!&#xA;Set Up You can use docker or podman to run kraken-hub&#xA;Install Podman your certain operating system based on these instructions</description>
